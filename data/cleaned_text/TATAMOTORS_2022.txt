6. OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (a) Accounting policy Intangible assets purchased, including those acquired in business combinations, are measured at cost which is the fair value as of the date of acquisition where applicable less accumulated amortization and impairment, if any. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed annually to determine whether an indefinite-life assessment continues to be supportable. If not, the change in the useful-
life assessment from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
The amortisation period for intangible assets with finite useful lives is reviewed at least at each year-end. Changes in expected useful lives are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Internally generated intangible asset Research costs are charged to the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the year in which they are incurred.

IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF JAGUAR LAND ROVER BUSINESS The operations of its subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), excluding equity accounted investments, represents a single cash- generating unit (“CGU”). This is because of the closely connected nature of the cash flows and the degree of integrated development and manufacturing activities.
In response to the annual requirement of accounting standard, management performed an impairment assessment as at March 31,
2022.
For the year ended March 31, 2022 assessment, the recoverable value was determined using the value in use (“VIU”) approach.
reversed because the underlying reasons for the increased headroom (including the unwind of the discount rate and the impact of depreciation and amortisation of impaired assets) do not support this.
a function of the JLR’s Cycle Plan assumptions, historic performance and management’s expectation of future market developments through to 2026/27.
standard. Additionally, management has considered other risks that have arisen due to the current economic uncertainty and the near-term supply chain challenges related to global chip shortages which has significantly impacted the JLR in FY22 .
The approach and key assumptions used to determine JLR’s CGU VIU were as follows:
result of the Reimagine strategy announced in the previous year, which especially results in a change in product portfolio in the outer years of the business plan.
from depreciation and amortisation expectations and funding requirements in responses to longer-term industry trends which are anticipated in the VIU calculation.
Discount rate – is regarded as a key assumption as the rate which drives the discounted cashflows used to determine the VIU of the CGU. The discount rate has been assessed based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model and a market participant after tax cost of debt.
These inputs are based on a typical build up approach.
of the recoverable amount lies in the VIU terminal value, management have focussed disclosures on reasonably possible changes that impact the terminal value.
a net impact on terminal period cash flows to be the best means of indicating the sensitivity of the model to such changes in the terminal period.

6-107 108-231 Integrated Statutory Report Reports Notes Forming Part of Consolidated Financial Statements The value of key assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amount are as follows:
The table below shows the amount by which the value assigned to the key assumptions must change for the recoverable amount of the CGU to be equal to its carrying amount:
value. The company also periodically assesses if there are any triggers for reversal of previously recognised impairment loss. A reversal of impairment loss is recognised if there is a trigger for reversal and the recoverable value exceeds the carrying value.
compared with the assumed performance at the time when the impairment loss was recorded. Based on this reassessment, the Company has reversed the initially recognised impairment for this CGU.
The key drivers for this improved performance include :
these factors enabled the Company to enhance it’s market share to 8.1% for the year ended March 31, 2021 as compared to 4.8% for the year ended March 31, 2020.

Consolidated Notes Forming Part of Consolidated Financial Statements The recoverable value was determined using the Fair value less cost of Disposal (“FVLCD”). CGU’s FVLCD has been valued using Comparable Company Market Multiple method (CCM). The average of enterprise value to sales multiple of Comparable Companies applied to actual sales of the CGU for year ended March 31, 2021 has been considered as the FVLCD as per CCM. The fair value of the CGU is as follows:
Recoverable amount 14,618.60 The approach and key (unobservable) assumptions used to determine the CGU’s FVLCD were as follows:
The carrying value of the CGU was `5,853.39 crores as at March 31, 2021, compared with the recoverable value of `14,618.60 crores, determined by FVCLD and `10,588.00 crores as per VIU.
Enterprise value to Sales multiple 1.27 The impairment reversal in the year ended March 31, 2021 was as follows:
The change in the following assumptions used in the impairment review would, in isolation, lead to a change in FVCLD as at March 31, 2021 (although it should be noted that these sensitivities do not take account of potential mitigating actions):
outlook a reversal of provision aggregating `777.00 crores had been accounted. During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company had also made provision for estimated supplier claims of `114.00 crores, which were under negotations with supplier.
accordingly provision for impairment towards the assets is reversed amounting to `38.18 crores (GBP 3.8 million) and `48.08 crores (EURO 5.6 million) in TMETC and Trilix, respectively.

42. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (A). Accounting Policy Recognition A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments are recognised on the balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument Initial measurement Initially, a financial instrument is recognised at its fair value. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of
financial instruments are recognised in determining the carrying amount, if it is not classified as at fair value through profit or loss.
Transaction costs of financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.
Subsequently, financial instruments are measured according to the category in which they are classified.

equity instruments and are designated as such upon initial recognition irrevocably. Subsequently, these are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, net of applicable income taxes.
Dividends from these equity investments are recognised in the statement of Profit and Loss when the right to receive payment has been established.

attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss are immediately recognised in profit and loss.
Classification and measurement – financial liabilities:
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in profit or loss.
Financial guarantee contracts: These are initially measured at their fair values and, are subsequently measured at the higher of the amount of loss allowance determined or the amount initially recognized less, the cumulative amount of income recognized.
Other financial liabilities: These are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Equity instruments:
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences residual interests in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (fair value of the consideration given or received).
In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.

Consolidated Notes Forming Part of Consolidated Financial Statements Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company determines the fair value of financial instruments that are quoted in active markets using the quoted bid prices (financial assets held) or quoted ask prices (financial liabilities held) and using valuation techniques for other instruments. Valuation techniques include discounted cash flow method and other valuation methods.

Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the statement of Profit and Loss in the periods in which the forecasted transactions occurs.
hedge and the changes in fair value attributable to forward premium is recognised in the other comprehensive income along with the changes in fair value determined to be effective portion of the hedge.
Effective portion of fair value changes of interest rate swaps that are designated as hedges against interest rate risk arising from floating rate debt are recognised in other comprehensive income.

6-107 108-231 Integrated Statutory Report Reports Notes Forming Part of Consolidated Financial Statements Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to the statement of profit and loss in the periods in which the forecast transactions affect profit or loss or as an adjustment to a non-financial item (e.g. inventory) when that item is recognised on the balance sheet. These deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in profit or loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example through cost of goods sold). For forecast transactions, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained there until the forecast transaction occurs.
If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the statement of Profit and Loss for the year.
