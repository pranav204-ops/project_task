would be most affected by climate change events, for example, scarcity of certain commodities driving up costs and therefore adversely impacting variable profit.
T he assessment of impairment is based on forecasts of future cashflows which are inherently uncertain and are developed using informed assumptions such as historical trends and market information. The key assumptions are:
(i) the recoverable amount is most sensitive;
(ii) involve a significant amount of judgement and estimation; and (iii) drive significant changes to the recoverable amount when flexed under reasonably possible outcomes.

32-2202 / tropeR detargetnI 054 Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial Statements Variable profit per unit and volumes – The approach to determining the forecast variable profit per unit and volumes is based on consideration of historical performance, the order bank, profit optimisation efforts and Group Cycle Plan assumptions, along with the impact of risks on future cashflows discussed above. A small change in either assumption may have a significant impact to future cashflows and for this reason, as well as the impact of risks associated with supply and inflationary pressures on variable profit and volumes, JLR consider variable profit per unit and volumes to be key assumptions. Further, the variable profit per unit and volumes included in the business plan are largely driven by an updated portfolio, which includes estimates and judgements related to the transition to electrified powertrain, including the introduction of new Jaguar.
involved in the calculation of terminal value capital expenditure, as well as the sensitivity of the recoverable amount to any change in the value, JLR consider this to be a key assumption.
the CGU primarily due to the level of judgement and estimation involved and the sensitivity of the recoverable amount to small changes in the percentage.

Sensitivity to Key Assumptions The value of key assumptions used to calculate the recoverable amount are as follows:
portion of the recoverable amount related to the VIU terminal value, JLR consider a net impact on terminal period cash flows to be the best means of indicating the sensitivity of key assumptions.
a reduction in the average variable profit per unit. Consequently, the terminal value variable profit sensitivity below incorporates sensitivity in volumes via the impact on variable profit.
