(i) Defined Benefit Plan (a) Gratuity Benefit (As per Actuarial valuation as on 31st March 2023) Towards Gratuity, during the year the discount rate had changed from 5.75% to 7.30 % in LIC administered Trust & expected rate of return on plan asset had changed from 5.75 % to 7.30 %.
Leaving service:
Employees (Other than Corporate Staff) is 30%. Leaving service due to disability is included in the provision made for all causes of leaving service.
Nature of benefits:
The gratuity benefits payable to the employees are based on the employee’s service and last drawn salary at the time of leaving.
The employees do not contribute towards this plan and the full cost of providing these benefits are met by the Company.
Governance of the plan:
The Company has setup an income tax approved irrevocable trust fund to finance the plan liability. The trustees of the trust fund are responsible for the overall governance of the plan.
Inherent risks:
experience or inadequate returns on underlying plan assets can result in an increase in cost of providing these benefits to employees in future. Since the benefits are lump sum in nature the plan is not subject to any longevity risks.
Funding arrangements and policy:
is within the permissible limits prescribed in the insurance regulations. Due to the restrictions in the type of investments that can be held by the fund, it is not possible to explicitly follow an asset-liability matching strategy to manage risk actively.
There is no compulsion on the part of the Company to fully pre fund the liability of the Plan. The Company’s philosophy is to fund the benefits based on its own liquidity and tax position as well as level of under funding of the plan.

Notes forming part of the Consolidated financial statements for the Year ended 31st March, 2023 c) Revenue recognition Operating Revenues Revenue from sale of goods is recognised when goods are delivered and control has been transferred to the buyer or buyer’s agents. Revenue from sale of goods is stated net of discounts, returns, applicable taxes and adjustment with respect to accrued loyalty points. Other operating revenues are recognised on accrual basis. Consideration received is allocated between goods sold and customer loyalty points issued, with the consideration allocated to the points equal to their fair value. The fair value of points issued is deferred and recognised as revenue when the points are redeemed.
Revenue from display and sponsorship services, commission on sales, fees, etc. is recognised when the service is provided to the customer.
Interest Income Interest income is recognised on an accrual basis using Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method.
Dividends Dividend income is recognised when right to receive the payment is established.
Rental income arising from operating lease is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where escalation in rent is in line with expected general inflation.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

Notes forming part of the Consolidated financial statements for the Year ended 31st March, 2023 Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of Profit or Loss when the asset is derecognised.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:
• Fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;
• Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date;
• The amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;
• Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the lease.
The lease liability is presented as a separate line in the financial statements.
The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made.
The Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset) whenever:

or before the commencement day, less any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter period of lease term and useful life of the underlying asset.
If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset.
The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease.
The right-of-use assets are presented as a separate line in the financial statements.
The Group applies Ind AS 36 to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss as described in the ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ policy.

Group as Lessor The Group enters into lease agreements as a lessor with respect to some of its investment properties.
Leases for which the Group is a lessor are classified as finance or operating leases. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease.

Notes forming part of the Consolidated financial statements for the Year ended 31st March, 2023 All other leases are classified as operating leases.
When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for the head lease and the sub-lease as two separate contracts.
The sub-lease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.
direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Subsequent Measurement For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:
• Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).
Debt Instruments at Amortized Cost A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortized cost if both the following conditions are met:

Notes forming part of the Consolidated financial statements for the Year ended 31st March, 2023 Debt Instrument at FVTPL F VTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.
