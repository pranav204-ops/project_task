There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to P&L, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.
Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the Profit and loss statement.
Equity instruments / Investments in subsidiaries / Joint Ventures / Associates are accounted at cost in accordance with Ind AS 27 - Separate Financial Statements.

TRENT LIMITED Notes forming part of the Standalone financial statements for the year ended 31st March, 2021 Note 3 3.1 Significant accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the Company’s standalone financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances existing when the financial statements were prepared. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revision to accounting estimates is recognized in the year in which the estimates are revised
and in any future year affected.

an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming, that market participants act in their best economic interest.

• Level 1 — Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2 (if Level 1 feed is not available/appropriate) — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
• Level 3 (if Level 1 and 2 feed is not available/appropriate) — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.
