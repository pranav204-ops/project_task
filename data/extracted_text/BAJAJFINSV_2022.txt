Dear Members, Your directors present the fifteenth Annual Report along with the audited standalone and consolidated
financial statements for FY2022.
At the outset, your directors express their profound grief on sad demise of Shri Rahul Bajaj, the iconic leader

country, a vocal proponent of entrepreneurship, and a voice of the industry at large.

While he remained the torchbearer of a family legacy that dates back to the founding days of our country, he
championed the creation of a new India.
While his passing away has left a huge void amongst us, he leaves behind an unparalleled foundation for all of
us to build upon.
The Board of Directors ('Board') places on record its whole-hearted appreciation of the invaluable
contribution made by him to the spectacular success of the Company and the Group over several decades.

Valuation of life insurance contract liabilities The liability for life insurance contracts is either based on current assumptions or on assumptions established at the inception of the contract, reflecting the best estimate at the time together with a margin for risk and adverse deviation. All contracts are subject to a liability adequacy test, which reflect Management’s best current estimate of future cash flows. The main assumptions used relate to mortality, morbidity, longevity, investment returns, expenses, lapse and surrender rates and
discount rates.
Fair values of unitised investment contracts are determined by reference to the values of the assets
backing the liabilities, which are based on the value of the unit-linked fund.

Revenue recognition a) Interest income BFL recognises interest income using effective interest rate (EIR) on all financial assets subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI).

carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability.

Risk management and other disclosures (Contd.) A. Bajaj Finance Ltd. (Contd.) g. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising out of a customer or counterparty failing to meet their
repayment obligations to BFL. It has a diversified lending model and focuses on six broad categories viz:
and (vi) commercial lending. BFL assesses the credit quality of all financial instruments that are subject
to credit risk.
Classification of financial assets under various stages
BFL classifies its financial assets in three stages having the following characteristics:
• stage 1: unimpaired and without significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition on which a
12-month allowance for ECL is recognised;
• stage 3: objective evidence of impairment, and are therefore considered to be in default or otherwise
credit impaired on which a lifetime ECL is recognised.

a life time ECL is calculated based on a lifetime PD.

Risk management and other disclosures (Contd.) A. Bajaj Finance Ltd. (Contd.) h. Collateral valuation BFL offers loans to customers across various lending verticals as articulated above. These loans includes both unsecured loans and loans secured by collateral. Although collateral is an important risk mitigant of credit risk, BFL's practice is to lend on the basis of assessment of the customer’s ability to repay rather than placing primary reliance on collateral. Based on the nature of product and BFL’s assessment of the customer's credit risk, a loan may be offered with suitable collateral. Depending on its form, collateral can
have a significant financial effect in mitigating BFL's credit risk.

consumer durable etc.

Further, BFL has also granted loans under RBI’s Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) to its
qualifying customers. As of 31 March 2022 ₹ 692.65 crore of loans are outstanding under ECLGS.
This has helped BFL to offset ₹ 148 crore worth of credit losses till FY2022 with further claims maturing
over FY2023 and FY2024.

It led to higher levels of infections and fatality causing severe toll on life. Fortunately, the curtailment actions by the government were more localised and well calibrated at city and specific zone levels enabling continuity and minimal disruption to economic activity throughout the country. Though this caused a marginal uptick in instalment default rate and compression in debt management efficiencies for a period of three months, the revival was quick and strong. As a result, unlike the first wave, the impact on the portfolio and loan losses was not as severe for BFL. Adequate investment in debt management services in FY2021 has
helped in curtailing the impact on the portfolio amidst the second wave as well.
metrics. Further, this agile, calibrated and closely monitored approach to credit risk and timely investment
in deepening of debt management services have enabled BFL to weather the pandemic well.
The third wave which started in mid-December 2021 had no significant impact on risk metrics both for
new business and the overall portfolio.
BFL carried out multiple risk simulations to assess the potential impact of the second and third wave of
the pandemic on portfolio risk and absorbed additional credit costs based on these simulations.

Risk management and other disclosures (Contd.) C. Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company Ltd. (BALIC) (Contd.) g. Insurance risk The principal risk BALIC faces under insurance contracts is that the actual claims and benefit payments or the timing thereof, differ from expectations. This is influenced by the frequency of
claims, severity of claims, actual benefits paid and subsequent development of long-term claims.
Therefore, the objective of BALIC is to ensure that the sufficient reserves are available to cover
these liabilities.
The main risk that BALIC is exposed are as follows
i. Mortality risk: Risk of loss due to policyholder death experiences being different than expected.
ii. Longevity risk: Risk of loss arising due to annuitant living longer than expected.
iii. Persistency risk: Risk of loss arising due to policyholder experiences (lapses and surrenders)
being different than expected.
iv. Morbidity risk: Risk of loss arising due to policyholder health experiences being different than
expected.
v. Expenses risk: Risk of loss arising due to expense experiences being different than expected.
vi. Investment risk: Risk of loss arising due from actual returns being different than expected.

implementation of underwriting strategy guidelines, as well as the reinsurance arrangement.

Derivatives (BALIC) BALIC offers guaranteed products wherein the policyholders are assured of a fixed rate of return for premiums to be received in the future. These premiums are likely to be received over a longer tenure and the guaranteed rate of return is fixed at the beginning of the policy term.

Accordingly, a fall in interest rates would mean lower interest earnings for BALIC from future investments, thereby exposing BALIC to interest rate risk.

investments, due to variations in market interest rates.

investment and provides for impairment, if any i.e. the deficit in the recoverable value over cost.
I. Classification
The Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:
income (FVTOCI), or through profit or loss (FVTPL)), and
• those to be measured subsequently at amortised cost.
The classification is done depending upon the Company’s business model for managing the
financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.
profit or loss or other comprehensive income, as elected. For assets classified as ’measured at
amortised cost’, this will depend on the business model and contractual terms of the cash flows.
The Company determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages
groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective.
The Company's business model is not assessed on an instrument-by-instrument basis, but at a
higher level of aggregated portfolios and is based on observable factors such as:
assets held in that business model, but incorporates such information when assessing newly
originated or newly purchased financial assets going forward.
As a second step of its classification process the Company assesses the contractual terms of
financial instruments to identify whether they meet the SPPI test.
‘Principal’ for the purpose of this test is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial
recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset.
The most significant elements of interest within a lending arrangement are typically the
consideration for the time value of money and credit risk.

The Company may strengthen its process of materiality identification and prioritisation of material topics through
engagement and feedback with internal and external stakeholders.

the Principle of Materiality.

Sustainability.
modes of engagement with these stakeholder groups as well as the key topics and concerns which have come out
